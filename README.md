# CSC120-FinalProject

>>Alternative design

Originally, we planned that there would be a class called Item, which records the name and location (xy axis) of certain items that can be interacted with throughout the game. However, after programming, we realized that the only valuable attribute for class Item is its name, and could be replaced by simply comparing the name in the string with input. This method can also make the program simpler since the printing of room descriptions can be combined: we planned to print the room description first and the item in the room second. But some of the items are in a container, which is not technically in the room. So this requires another comparison statement, which makes the codes more complicated, so we decided to abandon the Item class, and instead created a Container class.


>>Reflection

The final project was a great learning experience. My classmate and I decided to create a text-based videogame named "Escape the Room." It was a lot of fun to work on, and we were able to apply the skills we had acquired in object-oriented programming throughout the semester.

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was figuring out how to design the game mechanics and create a compelling story. We spent a lot of time brainstorming ideas and refining our concept, and eventually settled on a basic premise: the player is trapped in a room and must use their wits and resources to find the clues and unlock their way out.

For this project we used a variety of programming concepts and techniques, such as loops, conditionals, and functions. We also had to think carefully about the game's spaces' descriptions, and how to make it easy for players to interact with the game and understand what was happening.

Overall, I think the project was a great success. We were able to create a fun and engaging game that taught us a lot about programming and game design. I enjoyed the process of working on the project with Ashley, and I think we both learned a lot from the experience. We were grateful for the guidance and support of our instructor, who helped us understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and apply those concepts to our game.
